 norm_2nd_gen - conducts second generation spatial normalization on
                the characters in the specified mis structure given
                the primary space statistics on each character.
 norm_2nd_gen2 - conducts second generation spatial normalization on
                 the characters in the specified mis structure without
                 the use of primary space statistics.
 shear_mis - takes characters in the specified mis structure and
             horizontally shears them in order to straighten them up.
 shear_char - takes a binary bitmap of a character and horizontally
              shears it in order to straighten the character up.
