 concat_strings - concatenates two given strings together, returning one
                  new string.
 concat_strlist - concatenates all the strings in the specified list of
                  strings together, returning one new string.
 fatalerr - generic application error handler that prints a specified
            message to stderr and exits with a status of 1.
 free_names - deallocates an array of strings.

 int_groups - determines the number of contiguous groupings of
              characters belonging to a given set within another string.
 is_in_int_set - determines if the specified integer is a member
                 of the given set represetned as a string of integers.
 inv_bytes - takes an array of bytes and inverts them using a
             lookup table.
 remove_from_list - removes an integer from the given list by shifting
                    down all integers following the point of removal.
 remove_item - removes corresponding items from three lists of integers
               by shifting down all subsequent integers in the lists.
 maxpv - returns the first position and value of maximum in a vector
         of floats.
 multisort_INDEX - recursive multiple-index QuickSort utility accessed
                   through the Macro library in indexstruct.h .
 compute_mxs_mys - computes the geometric centers of boxes given
                   a list of box x, y, w, and h.
 nearest_nbor - returns the location of the point from a list of points
                that is closest to another specified point and returns
                the closest distance.
 newext - takes a filename, stips off the rightmost extenstion, and
          appends a new extension.
 to_rel_polar2 - converts a list of cartesian points indirectly 
                 referenced through an index list to polar coordinates
                 relative to a specified center point.
 ramp_int_runs - takes a list of integers, thresholds them into
                 binary values and assigns incrementally accumulated
                 run length vales into a new list.
 sort_index_dec_on_int - sorts an integer list into descending order.

 sort_index_on_int - sorts an integer list into ascending order.

 strippath - takes a full pathname and returns a pointer to the
             information to the right of the rightmost directory level.
 substring - determines if the first string is a substring of the
             the second provided string.
 syserr - exits on error with a status of -1, printing to stderr a
          caller-defined message and the system call error associated
          with errno.
 ticks - returns the number of clock cycles (ticks) used by a process.

 ticksPerSec - returns the system definition for HZ, where 1/HZ seconds
               is a tick (HZ = 60).
 current_time - returns a string containing the current date on the
                system.
 to_upper - takes the integer value of an ASCII character, and if the
            character is lowercase, converts it to uppercase.
 too_big - determines if the two floats passed, when summed together,
           exceed plus or minus a specified limit.
